<h1>Important note for sharded clusters!</h1>

<p>3.2.1 has a bug in it for mongoc config metadata, if you upgrade there is a chance that you will run into this and need to downgrade your mongos client until there is a fix:
<a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-22247">BUG-SERVER-22247</a></p>

<h1>Steps to upgrade:</h1>

<ul>
<li>Upgrade each shard (mongod)</li>
<li>upgrade the config servers starting with the last in the config string</li>
<li>upgrade all mongos instances</li>
</ul>
